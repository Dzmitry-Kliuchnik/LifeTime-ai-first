----------------------------------------refined prompt-----------------------------------
Design a lifetime calendar app that divides a person's life into weeks. The app should include the following features:

1. **User Input**:
   - Allow users to input their date of birth and expected lifespan (e.g., 80 years by default, but customizable).
   - Calculate the total number of weeks in the user's life based on the input.

2. **Visual Representation**:
   - Display a grid or timeline where each square or segment represents one week of the user's life.
   - Use color coding to differentiate past, present, and future weeks:
     - Past weeks: Greyed out.
     - Current week: Highlighted.
     - Future weeks: Default color.
   - Additionally mark every week that contains first day of the calendar year with bold left border for the square.	
   - Additionally mark every week that contains birthday with bold left border for the square but with different color.	

3. **Customization**:
   - Enable users to create notes for the current and passed weeks.
   
4. **Progress Tracking**:
   - Show a progress bar or percentage indicating how much of the user's life has passed based on the current date.

5. **Aesthetic and Accessibility**:
   - Offer multiple themes (e.g., minimalist, colorful, dark mode).
   - Ensure the app is accessible for users with visual impairments (e.g., screen reader compatibility, adjustable font sizes).

6. **Privacy and Security**:
    - Ensure user data is encrypted and stored securely.
    - Provide clear privacy policies and options for data deletion.

7. **Backend (Python):**
   - Use a Python web framework like FastAPI for the backend.
   - Create an API endpoint to calculate the total number of weeks in a person's life based on their birthdate and an average lifespan (e.g., 80 years).
   - Provide an API endpoint to fetch the current week of the user's life.
   - Store user data (e.g., birthdate, name) and weekly notes in a database (SQLite).
   - Include an API endpoint to update user information.

8. **Frontend (Vue.js):**
   - Create a responsive UI that displays a grid of weeks (e.g., 52 weeks per row for each year).
   - Highlight the current week in the grid.
   - Allow users to input their birthdate and see their lifetime calendar.
   - Include a feature to add notes to current and previous weeks.
   - Provide a settings page for users to update their information.

9. **Documentation:**
   - Provide clear documentation for setting up the development environment, running the app locally, and deploying it to production.
   - Include API documentation using tools like Swagger or ReDoc for the backend.

10. **Testing:**
   - Write unit tests for the backend using pytest.
   - Use a testing library like Jest for the Vue.js frontend.

Ensure the app is user-friendly, visually appealing, and adheres to modern web development best practices.


------------------------refined prompt 2---------------------------------
- Objective: Design a lifetime calendar web app that divides a person’s life into weeks, with week-level visualization, notes, and progress tracking.

- Core Inputs
	- User provides date_of_birth and expected_lifespan_years (default 80 , user-adjustable).
	- Compute total_weeks = floor(((DOB + lifespan_years) - DOB) / 7 days) using exact date arithmetic (account leap years).
	- Define week boundaries using ISO 8601 (weeks start Monday, local timezone). current_week_index = floor((today_local - DOB) / 7 days) .

- Visualization	
	- Render a responsive grid timeline: 52 columns per row (year), rows = ceil(total_weeks / 52) . Handle partial last row.
	- Color states: past weeks grey, current week highlighted, future weeks default.
	- Special borders:
		- Year-start: bold left border for any week containing Jan 1 of a given year.
		- Birthday: bold left border in a distinct color for the week containing the user’s birthday.
		- Conflict resolution: if birthday coincides with a year-start week, apply birthday border style with a small “Jan 1” marker.
	- Accessibility: keyboard navigable grid; screen-reader labels “Week N of M, Year Y”.

- Notes
	- Users can create and edit notes for current and past weeks; future weeks read-only (no notes).
	- Notes are stored per week_index and user; support plain text (optional markdown), basic search, and edit history.

- Progress
	- Show progress: percentage of life elapsed, numeric current_week / total_weeks , and a progress bar.
	
- Themes & Accessibility
	- Provide light, dark, and high-contrast themes; persist theme choice.
	- Adjustable font sizes; ensure WCAG AA contrast; ARIA roles for grid and controls.

- Privacy & Security

	- Store data in SQLite with at-rest encryption (e.g., SQLCipher) or OS-level disk encryption; keep encryption key in environment variables.
	- Provide data export (JSON) and deletion; clear privacy policy page.
	
- Backend (FastAPI)
	- Endpoints:
		- GET /weeks/total?dob&lifespan_years → { total_weeks } .
		- GET /weeks/current?dob → { current_week_index } (uses local timezone unless tz specified).
		- GET /users/{id} → user profile.
		- PATCH /users/{id} → update dob , lifespan_years , name , theme , font_size .
		- GET /notes?week_index&user_id → list notes.
		- POST /notes → create note { user_id, week_index, content } (reject future weeks).
		- PUT /notes/{id} → update note.
		- DELETE /notes/{id} → delete note.
	- OpenAPI docs enabled (Swagger UI at /docs , ReDoc at /redoc ).
	- Timezone handling: default to server TZ; accept optional tz parameter (IANA zone).


- Frontend (Vue.js)
	- Use Vue 3 + Vite; composition API; TypeScript.
	- Pages: Lifetime Grid, Notes Drawer/Modal, Settings, Privacy.
	- Grid: 52-week rows, virtualized rendering for performance (e.g., dynamic v-for with windowing).
	- Highlights and borders per rules; tooltips show week number, date range, and note count.
	- Forms to input dob , lifespan_years ; persist settings to backend.

- Data Model
	- users(id, name, dob, lifespan_years, theme, font_size, created_at, updated_at) .
	- notes(id, user_id, week_index, content, created_at, updated_at) with unique (user_id, week_index) if only one note per week.

- Calculations & Edge Cases
	- Use exact date math ( relativedelta ) to add lifespan years; compute weeks via date difference, flooring to whole weeks.
	- Handle leap years, DST, timezone differences; ensure consistent week indexing.
	- If DOB is in the future, return validation error.

- Documentation
	- Setup guides: dev, local run, production deploy (env vars, DB init, TLS).
	- API docs via OpenAPI; include example requests/responses.

- Testing
	- Backend: pytest unit tests for week calculation, current week, notes rules (no future notes), and birthday/year-start detection.
	- Frontend: Jest + Vue Test Utils for grid rendering, highlighting, notes UI, settings persistence.

- Non-Functional
	- Performance: virtualize large grids; lazy-load notes; cache user profile.
	- Reliability: input validation with pydantic ; error handling with clear messages.
	- Internationalization ready (date formats, locale strings) without altering week rules.


- Acceptance Criteria
	- Given a DOB and lifespan, the grid renders total_weeks with correct past/current/future colors.
	- Weeks containing Jan 1 have bold left borders; birthday weeks have a distinct bold left border; collisions prefer birthday styling with “Jan 1” marker.
	- Progress bar and percentage match computed values.
	- Notes can be added/edited for current/past weeks; future weeks disabled.
	- Accessibility checks (keyboard, screen-reader labels, contrast) pass.
	- API endpoints return expected payloads; docs available at /docs.
